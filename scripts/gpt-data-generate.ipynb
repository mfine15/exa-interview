       "  'Discussion in \\'Mac OS X Lion (10.7)\\' started by axboi87, Jan 20, 2012.\\nI\\'ve got a 500gb internal drive and a 240gb SSD.\\nWhen trying to restore using disk utility i\\'m given the error \"Not enough space on disk ____ to restore\"\\nBut I shouldn\\'t have to do that!!!\\nAny ideas or workarounds before resorting to the above?\\nUse Carbon Copy Cloner to copy one drive to the other. I\\'ve done this several times going from larger HDD to smaller SSD and I wound up with a bootable SSD drive. One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won\\'t be bootable. CCC usually works in \"file mode\" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that\\'s mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall).\\nI\\'ve actually done this somehow on Disk Utility several times (booting from a different drive (or even the dvd) so not running disk utility from the drive your cloning) and had it work just fine from larger to smaller bootable clone. Definitely format the drive cloning to first, as bootable Apple etc..\\nThanks for pointing this out. My only experience using DU to go larger to smaller was when I was trying to make a Lion install stick and I was unable to restore InstallESD.dmg to a 4 GB USB stick but of course the reason that wouldn\\'t fit is there was slightly more than 4 GB of data.',\n",

       "  'Sysco Corp. has terminated its planned $3.5 billion takeover of US Foods, it announced Monday, after a federal judge blocked the combination. The company is opting instead to add $3 billion to its stock-buyback program.\\nWith the deal breaking up, Sysco will pay a $300 million termination fee to US Foods and a $12.5 million fee to Performance Food Group, which had agreed to buy some US Foods facilities. Sysco, based in Houston, plans to make the share repurchases over the next two years.\\nRosemont, Illinois-based US Foods operates a major distribution center in Fishers. Sysco has a large warehouse at 4000 W. 62nd St., in Indianapolis.\\nSysco had fought for more than a year to gain government approval for the transaction, which antitrust regulators said would hurt competition and lead to higher prices. Sysco and US Foods dominate a market known as broadline foodservice, which supplies school cafeterias, restaurants and hotels. Sysco had argued that the acquisition would bring $1 billion in savings, letting it offer lower prices to customers.\\nInvestors have responded with relief to the deal’s demise, reflecting concerns about the company undertaking an ambitious merger. Sysco shares rose 3.1 percent the day the transaction was halted by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, and the stock climbed again Monday morning after the merger was withdrawn.\\nMehta blocked the merger on June 23 when he granted a Federal Trade Commission request to delay the transaction. The FTC had sued the companies in February, saying the deal would give Sysco an oversized share of an industry where it’s already the biggest player.\\nIn arguments before Mehta in May, the two sides clashed over the scope of the market in which the companies compete. Sysco and US Foods argued that the commission was relying on a “tortured” analysis, ignoring the variety of distribution channels available to customers.\\nSysco said on Monday that it weighed embarking on an appeal but decided against it.\\nShares of Sysco rose as much as 1.6 percent to $39 in early trading. The stock had slid 3.3 percent this year through the end of last week.'],\n",

Two panes in the lesser window were broken, and as the door was locked I looked through the lower of the broken panes and satisfied myself that the mutilated corpse lying on the bed was not in need of any immediate attention from me, and I also came to the conclusion that there was nobody else upon the bed, or within view, to whom I could render any professional assistance. Having ascertained that probably it was advisable that no entrance should be made into the room at that time, I remained until about 1.30p.m., when the door was broken open by McCarthy, under the direction of Superintendent Arnold. On the door being opened it knocked against a table which was close to the left-hand side of the bedstead, and the bedstead was close against the wooden partition.

Analysis of the simulated vehicle exhibited similar behavior to that of the actual vehicle in most of the flight data collected.

Or, is there enough of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Bradyrhizobia japonicum, remaining in the soil?\\nTrue, rhizobial bacteria don’t survive wet conditions very well. But whether it will pay to use an inoculant depends largely on whether soybeans were grown in the field sometime during the last five years or if the field has been flooded for more than a week, says Aaron Saeugling, Iowa State University Extension field agronomist in southwest Iowa.\\nThe presence of rhizobia in the soil is necessary for a legume such as soybeans to be able to convert nitrogen from the atmosphere into a form usable by the plant, he says.

For nitrogen fixation to occur, the nitrogen-fixing bacteria need to be readily available in the soil or must be applied to the seed.\\nWhen soybean seed germinates, the rhizobia bacteria invade the root hairs of the seedling and begin to multiply. Nodules, the structures that house the bacteria, form on the roots. Under field conditions, nodule formation can be seen shortly after emergence, but active nodule fixation of N from the air doesn’t begin until about the V2 to V3 growth stage of beans. After that point, the number of nodules formed and amount of nitrogen fixed increase with time until about midway between the R5 and R6 growth stages; then N fixation decreases sharply.\\nApplying nitrogen fertilizer for soybeans isn’t recommended because it typically doesn’t increase bean yields in Iowa production systems.',\n",

Overall, the ISU studies haven’t shown a consistent yield response to use of soybean inoculants in fields in Iowa with a history of having soybeans grown on them.\\nCurrent recommendations for Iowa are to inoculate the seed if a field has never been planted to soybeans, or if beans haven’t been grown in the field for the past three to five years.',\n",

But the use of inoculants to increase yield may not be the answer, especially if beans have been grown in the field recently.

Did you experience triumph or tragedy?\\nIf you’re like most, it was a mixture of both. Sometimes it’s hard to discern the difference. What some see as catastrophe, others view as a success. It really depends on your perspective. Of course, the New Year is always a good time to make a change for the better in your own life.\\nBut be aware that most statistics show that only around 46 percent of resolutions continue past six months.

The strategic practice of product differentiation became so prevalent and such a point of emphasis that it even gave way to the commonly heard parlance of retail being a \"merchant-led business.\"\\nThe growth of e-commerce in the 1990s and 2000s rewrote the playbook though.

Mercury is used extensively in ASM operations, and often in highly unsafe domestic conditions, to process ore and recover gold.\\nBut for small-scale miners working with simple tools and lacking the deep pockets, greater pressure to stop using mercury hasn’t changed the economic fundamentals of their trade.',\n",
